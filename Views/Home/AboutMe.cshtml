    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Simphiwe Skhonde. I am a 20-year-old student at the University of Pretoria studying Geography and Environmental Science with my second major in Geoinformatics. I am currently in my second year of my studies. I took INF272 as an extra module this year because I realised last year with the prerequisites for this module that I enjoyed coding even though it was challenging. Some hobbies I enjoy are playing tennis, reading books and spending time outdoors doing activities such as hiking and having a pleasant picnic </p>
